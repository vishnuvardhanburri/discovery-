 *
 * It REUSES OwnerSelector (which in turn builds the evidence string that
 * IntelligenceEngine.identifyTechnicalOwner treats as explicit public listing).
 * The DeepOwner is a richer, provenance-preserving representation: it keeps the
 * verbatim candidate evidence, the responsibility match, and the confidence.
